## üìò Project Overview  
This repository contains the code, documentation, and supporting files for our capstone project in collaboration with the [The Tobacco E-Commerce Lab](https://www.tobaccoecommercelab.com) at UC San Diego. The project investigates how local flavor bans and demographic factors are associated with the presence and behavior of e-commerce tobacco retailers, using San Diego County as a pilot case and preparing a foundation for replication accross California.

We developed two research products:
1. An **interactive dashboard** visualizing e-commerce-enabled tobacco retailers, policy coverage, and local demographics.
2. A series of **statistical analyses** examining policy and socioeconomic predictors of e-commerce activity and flavored product sales.
