## üîç Overview
This project investigates how vape shops‚Äô use of e-commerce varies across neighborhoods with and without flavored tobacco bans in San Diego County. Using API-sourced retailer data and demographic variables, we assessed policy impacts and created a public-facing dashboard to support enforcement of flavored tobacco restrictions.

## üìç Dashboard Access
The interactive map dashboard is hosted on the Tobacco E-Commerce Lab‚Äôs website. Due to the sensitive nature of compliance data, access is restricted.

## **Introduction**
We explore how flavored tobacco bans and neighborhood demographics are associated with vape shops' use of e-commerce. This work supports local enforcement by identifying gaps in compliance and leveraging public data.

## **Methods**
Using a sample of 311 vape shops in San Diego County, we merged business listing data with census tract demographics and policy coverage. Logistic regression tested predictors of e-commerce activity.

## **Results**
- **Flavor bans** were *not* significantly associated with e-commerce presence  
- **Higher income areas** had *increased* odds of e-commerce presence  
- **Higher deprivation and youth population** were linked to *reduced* odds  
- **57.9%** of delivery-enabled retailers in banned areas sold flavored products

## **Conclusion**
Flavor bans alone are insufficient to reduce online flavored tobacco sales. Data dashboards like ours can aid targeted enforcement efforts.
